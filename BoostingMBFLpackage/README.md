The MBFL approach to be boosted in our experiment is MUSE form paper <Ask the Mutants: Mutating Faulty Programs for Fault Localization>.  
To avoid randomness caused by mutation, we directly utilized the suspicious score calculated in paper <An Empirical Study of Fault Localization Families and Their Combinations>. 
Such MBFL suspicious scores are recorded in json file. 

To evaluate our boosting performance, you only need to execute the main function of experiment.java

"MBFL" document: The source code of our experiment. You could directly execute the main function of experiment.java.

"llpjason" document: It contains the data of the suspicious scores calculated by MBFL approach and the statement type information.

"MBFLresult" document: It is the execution result of our experiment.
