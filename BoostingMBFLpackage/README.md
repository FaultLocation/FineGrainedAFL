The MBFL approach to be boosted in our experiment is MUSE form paper <Ask the Mutants: Mutating Faulty Programs for Fault Localization>.  To avoid randomness caused by mutation, we directly utilized the suspicious score calculated in paper <An Empirical Study of Fault Localization Families and Their Combinations>. Such MBFL suspicious scores are recorded in json file. To evaluate our boosting performance, you only need to execute the main function of experiment.java
